Web-MVC framework based on PSR-7 middleware
===========================================
Master: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rindow/rindow-web-mvc.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rindow/rindow-web-mvc)

A flexible and ultra-lightweight Web-MVC framework.
Developers can develop applications into modules by namespace, and are designed to minimize dependencies among modules.

A template engine can be selected for each divided namespace, and can be grouped together with a controller and a model.

Model-Controller-View allows you to write framework independent code, so you can create very portable modules.

General PSR-7 middleware can be easily incorporated.
